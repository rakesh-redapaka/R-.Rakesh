It is the world's fourth-largest food crop, following rice, wheat and corn.[1] The annual diet of an average global citizen in the first decade of the 21st century included about 33 kg (73 lb) of potato.[1] The potato was first domesticated by the Andean civilizations in the region of modern-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia[2] between 8000 and 5000 BCE.[3] It has since spread around the world and has become a staple crop in many countries.</p>

    <summary>4.Brinjal curry</summary>
    <p>Baigan bharta, also spelled baingan bharta or baigan chokha[1] (mashed eggplant)[a] is an Indian dish prepared by mashing or mincing grilled eggplant (baigan) with tomato, onion, herbs and spices, with variations being common from chef to chef.[b] Traditionally, cooking the eggplants over charcoals, inside of a tandoor, barbecue grill or oven, or even directly applying flame to the outside of the fruit infuses the dish with a smoky flavour; the blackened skin is then easily peeled and the eggplant may be further prepared.

        Baigan bharta is most often grilled, minced eggplant stewed with chopped tomato, browned onion or shallots, ginger, garlic, cumin, and topped with lime or lemon juice, fresh cilantro (coriander leaves) and sliced fresh green chili pepper</p>

    <p>The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.

        Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, and an annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.</p>

    <summary>2.Muuton curry</summary>
    <p>Mutton curry (also referred to as kosha mangsho,[1] lamb curry,[2] or goat curry[3][4]) is a dish that is prepared from goat meat (or sometimes lamb meat) and vegetables.[5] The dish is found in different variations across all states, countries and regions of the Indian subcontinent and the Caribbean.

        Mutton curry was originally prepared putting all the ingredients together in a earthen pot and slow cooking the whole curry by wood fire on a clay oven.[6] Today it is cooked using pressure cookers and slow cookers after briefly saut√©ing all the ingredients and spices in a big wok.[6] The steadily cooked mutton becomes more tender than normally cooked mutton. Mutton curry is generally served with rice or with Indian breads, such as naan or parotta.[7] The dish can also be served with ragi, a cereal.[8]</p>

    <summary>4.Fish head curry</summary>
    <p>It is believed that fish head curry was invented when chef M.J. Gomez from Kerala, India adopted the dish to bring South Indian cuisine to diners in Singapore. Although fish head was not widely served in India, Chinese customers considered it to be a special delicacy, so M.J. had the idea of cooking the fish in curry instead.[5] The dish was first sold in 1949, at the restaurant opened by Gomez.[6]

        Today, Indian, Malay, Chinese, and Peranakan restaurants all serve variations of this dish. Fish head curry has become a popular dish among Singaporeans and tourists alike. Costing between $10 and $20, it is generally not considered cheap hawker fare. It typically comes served in a clay pot, and is often sold at hawker centers and neighbourhood food stalls.</p>
